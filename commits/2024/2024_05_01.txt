* Several updates 2024_05_01. See full commit log.

* Updated Traefik to v3 (on home server - hs). The rest will be migrated over slowly.
* Syntax updated for Traefik v3 compatibility - Headers to Header, HeadersRegexp to HeaderRegexp, HostSNIRegexp, etc. Check https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/traefik-v3-docker-compose-guide-2024/#Migrating_from_Traefik_v2_to_v3.
* "t2_proxy" network is now "t3_proxy" to represent Traefik v3. Subnet 192.168.90.0/24 remains the same.
* Continuing to maintain both Traefik v2 and Traefik v3 appdata folders (at least for a few more months).
* Removed compress middleware - was causing unnessary log warnings about mime type. I could not find a solution.
* Removed Docker Compose version tags. 
* Added Authelia, Scrutiny, Kasm (WIP), and Firefly + Importer.
* Bash Aliases updates.
* Nginx verion update to 1.24 in web server (ws).
* docker-compose-dns.yml is work-in-progress.
