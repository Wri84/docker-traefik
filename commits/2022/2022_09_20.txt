* Several updates 2022_09_20. See full commit log.

* The biggest change is the addition of CrowdSec intrusion prevention system to my environment. It is mitigating well over 600 intrusion attempts per day.
* Added some new middlewares chains in middlewares-chains.yml to support the addition of CrowdSec. 
* Renamed traefik bouncer middleware in middlewares.yml.
* Modified Dockerfile-php7 to supress some errors in php logs.
* Fixed minor mistakes in my rclone scripts.
* Modified media-services.txt to reflect current setup.
* Updated bash_aliases - major change is the addition of commands for CrowdSec.
* Edited README.

docker-compose-t2.yml
* Fixed a typo chain-auth-basic to chain-basic-auth
* Added CrowdSec (agent). Although an agent is installed here, my primary agent (the mothership; the decision maker) is the one in docker-compose-t2-web.yml. This instance just parses the logs but makes no decisions.
* Obsoleted CrowdSec dashboard - was using too much resources.
* Modified traefik bouncer to get decisions from the "mothership" crowdsec remote agent instead of the local agent.
* Added Prometheus to harvest some CrowdSec stats. I can now visualize metrics on my Grafana. 
* Obsoleted YoutubeDL-Material - could never get this to work. It has worked for others.
* Obsoleted Flaresolverr - Saw no real use for my situation. 
* Renamed airsonic service to airsonic-advanced.
* Added Plex Meta Manager - will push my configs as example at a later point.
* Re-Added Tautulli.

docker-compose-t2-synology.yml
* Added ZeroTier. Now all my key hosts are connected through ZeroTier and Plex, Arr apps, etc. can be accessed using ZeroTier IPs. 
* Re-Added Plex-Sync to sync watched status between two Plex servers.
* VS Code server has been giving me issues recently and is currently non functional on Synology.
* Minor changes to DDNS updater

docker-compose-t2-web.yml
* Biggest change is the addition of CrowdSec. CrowdSec on my Digital Ocean VPS is the primary agent. 
* Added wg-easy for easy Wireguard deployment. This will run on my Digital Ocean VPS, which will be always on and the most reliable of all my servers.
* Modified logging for serveral apps (eg. Traefik, Nginx, etc.) to simplify CrowdSec implementation. These logs will be parsed by CrowdSec agent for malicious activities and decisions (ban) will be sent to the bouncers. 
* Added CrowdSec cloudflare bouncer to block malicious IPs using Cloudflare managed rules. Unfortunately CrowdSec limits blocklist to max 10,000 IPs. For the rest, see below.
* Added CrowdSec Traefik bouncer to block malicious IPs.
* In addition, installed CrowdSec Firewall bouncer on host machine to make Linux firewall block malicious IPs. 
* Replaced CF trusted IPs list with an environmental variable with same info. Looks cleaner.
