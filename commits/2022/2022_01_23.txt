* Several updates 2022_01_23. See full commit log.
* Big change 1: my web stack is now part of the same Proxmox host that runs my home/media server. Previously it was on Digital Ocean.
* Big change 2: moved most of my services from NUC/ASROCK 4x4-4800U to Synology for homelab use. So no more docker-compose-t2-nuc.yml.
* Updated docker version to 20.10.12.
* Updated docker-compose version to 1.29.2.
* Updated compose file version to 3.9.
* Updated README with additional information. As mentioned in previous commit CHANGELOG is now discontinued due to detailed commit messages such as this one. Only the "planned" section of CHANGELOG will be updated.
* Minor customizations to upload-media.sh.example for uploading media from local drive to google drive (rclone).
* Updated upload-excludes.log.example to exclude partial~, torrents, .part, and incomplete downloads from being uploaded to google drive.
* Updated start-media-after-boot.sh - the script waits until all drives are mounted (rclone and MergerFS) before starting media containers (media-services.txt).
* Updated media-services.txt as the list of services I use have changed - e.g. Plex moved to synology.
* Updated check-mounts.sh with minor tweaks - this script checks for all required mounts periodically to either keep-alive or stop the media containers.
* Updated middlewares.yml to add missing middlewares-https-redirectscheme - https://github.com/htpcBeginner/docker-traefik/issues/187.
* Added middlewares-oauth-external (middlewares.yml) to offload authentication to an external service that was already running OAuth (reduce duplication).
* Added few additional middlewares (middlewares.yml) for testing - compression and traefik buffering issues.
* Updated middlewares-chains.yml to add compression middleware and chain-oauth-external for external OAuth as explained above.
* Removed authelia from home server. Still used on web stack.
* Obsoleted Organizr and Heimdall - wasn't using much and my Proxmox host is not too powerful. I might add it back later.
* Removed all database services (MariaDB, Redis, phpMyAdmin, InfluxDB, RedisCommander, etc.) from docker-compose.yml. This reduced duplicated services. Since the web stack is now a guest on the same Proxmox host. Services on docker-compose.yml now use database services from the web stack.
* Added prowlarr for testing - replacement for Jackett.
* Obsoleted LazyLibrarian, Caliber, and Caliber-web - wasn't using them.
* Added Readarr for testing.
* AirSonic development stopped. Plus, the database corrupted twice. Obsoleted it and added NaviDrome and FunkWhale for testing.
* Removed Plex from docker-compose.yml. It is now part of my Synology stack at home. Still running Jellyfin in the cloud as a backup and to share with others.
* Due to the above reason, also moved Tautulli to Synology.
* Obsoleted FileBot, Photoshow and autoscan - wasn't using them.
* Added Synthing - I now use this to sync scripts, compose files, etc. between various systems. 
* Obsoleted StatPing temporarily - I will probably add it back.
* Obsoleted Traefik Error Pages - did not find a way to use for wordpress
* Removed cert dumper, dozzle, and glaces from web stack to keep things light. May add it later if resources can handle it.
* Obsoleted Unifi Controller - I do not use Unifi at this point (I wish I could). I do not have the time to set it up (lack of cables, etc.) after the move.
* Added tdarr and tdarr-node to Synology to transcode videos to H265/HEVC - only small home clips. Synology is too underpowered for transcoding movies. 
* Added Rclone service (both unencrypted and encrypted) to Synology to mount media from google drive.
