* Several updates 2023_03_02. See full commit log.

* Converted by Synology M2 drives from cache device to a volume for docker. Significantly faster docker performance. Consequently few minor changes to paths (volume1 to volume3)
* Updated traefik app yml for Home Assistant OS. 
* Replaced Transmission (with built in VPN killswitch) with Gluetun and Surfshark Wireguard VPN (https://bit.ly/shb-surfshark). 
* Replaced Transmission with qBittorrent (which I prefer) via Glueten VPN.
* Added a whoami container on home server for testing purposes.
* Replaced Dashy with Homepage.
* Added deunhealth so qBittorrent heals after VPN disconnects/restarts
* Updated docker and docker compose versions
