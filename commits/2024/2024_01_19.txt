* Several updates 2024_01_19. See full commit log.

* Biggest structural change in a long time to align with what Auto-Traefik does.
    - Renamed all Docker compose files (remove t2 suffix)
    - Now all docker compose files have their hostname as suffix (for my 5 Docker hosts)
* Split the big long docker compose files into individual service YMLs using Docker include: /compose folder.
* Moved all archived compose files into /compose/archives.
* Updated bash aliases - docker commands simplified, and more.
