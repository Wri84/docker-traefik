Oh boy! where do I even begin.

Lots of changes in this commit:

1. Moved some of the apps to Synology docker stack (dockerc-compose-t2-synology.yml) - Portainer, MariaDB, InfluxDB, Mosquitto MQTT Broker, Cloudflare DDNS, Redis. Add my NUC stack as a separate endpoint NAS Portainer.
2. Implemented Tecnativa Socket Proxy - Traefik, Portainer, Glances, Dozzle, Ouroboros, Docker-GC, Cloudflare Companion
3. Moved from Home Assistant Supervised to Home Assistant Core
4. Fixed multihost CNAME creation in Cloudflare Companion
5. Fully rolled out Docker secrets - Traefik, Authelia, Plex, Guacamole, OAuth, MariaDB, etc.. There are still some images that do not support secrets. 
6. Renamed docker-compose-synology-t2.yml to docker-compose-t2-synology.yml
7. Obsoleted SmokePing - no use for me
8. Obsoleted HA-DockerMon - could live without it. Tried to simplify my Home Assistant setup.
9. Obsoleted UniFi Controller - moved it to cloud.
10. Obsoleted Postgres - Hoping to use MySQL for StatPing
11. Updated readme with current information
12. Updated Authelia configuration.yml.example
13. Obsoleted ZoneMinder. Moved to MotionEye, which is much simpler to setup and use.

And last a big one that I have been working on:

13. Added docker-compose-t2-web.yml - This is contains all the apps that I run on my Digitial Ocean Virtual Private server. This server runs wordpress and couple of other dynamic (PHP) sites.
