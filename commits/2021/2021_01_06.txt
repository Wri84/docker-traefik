* Started moving partial stack to seed/cloud box.
* Created an appdata folder and moved all app folders into it (to tidy things up a bit). 
* Moved htpasswd from shared folder to secrets. Edited middlewares-basic-auth. This changes the way htpasswd is called in docker-compose.
* Created a folder called "archives". Moved all Traefik v1 stuff into it. 
* Changed $DOMAINNAME to $DOMAINNAME0 
* Moved t2_proxy and socket_proxy subnets in docker compose file instead of outside the compose file (https://github.com/htpcBeginner/docker-traefik/discussions/119). Therefore, it is not necessary to create these networks external before starting the stack. Improved portability.
* Removed some environmental variables in paths to simplify things (eg. $SECRETSDIR is now $DOCKERDIR/secrets).
* Changed volumes for apps (eg. radarr, sonarr, etc.) to reduce unnecessary rewrites - https://trash-guides.info/Misc/how-to-set-up-hardlinks-and-atomic-moves/.
* Switched backed to tecnativa's socket proxy (fluencelabs socket proxy not updated for months).
* Updated thomseddon/traefik-forward-auth (OAuth) environmental variables to use PROVIDERS_GOOGLE_CLIENT and PROVIDERS_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET.
* Removed exposing ports to docker host. This was not needed on my cloud/seed box all apps could talk to each other using their internal static IPs.
* Removed exposing socket-proxy port. All apps connected to socket_proxy network can connect to the proxy using internal hostname.
* Changed Organizr image to organizr/organizr.
* Added $TZ to linuxserver/mariadb - statping MySQL did not work without it.
* Put mariadb, influxdb, and redis on "default" network and added dependent services to the network (eg. authelia, statping, PMA, Guacamole, etc.)
* Obsoleted Emby - Between Plex and Jellyfin all my needs are covered.
* Added readarr (nightly) - still alpha
* Added descriptions at the top for various docker-compose files.
* Added secrets_example folder and added some example secrets.
* Updated README.md and CHANGELOG.md.
* Added Rclone and MergerFS with Google Drive.
* Added systemd startup scripts for Rclone (rclone-drive.service and rclone-crypt.service)  and MergerFS (merge-media.service) based on https://github.com/animosity22/homescripts.
* Added media-services.txt, which list the services to stop using dcup2/dcstop2 $(cat media-services.txt)
* Changed restart on some containers dependent on MergerFS media folder to "no". Moved starting those containers to a bash script upon successful GDrive mount.
* Added a script to monitor the status of Rclone and MergerFS mount (check-mounts.sh). If one of the mount fails then media folder dependent services are automatically stopped and an email notification is sent.
* Added script to automatically/periodically move files from "local" to "remote" (Google Drive) for MergerFS (upload-media.sh).
* Added a script to move/convert unencrypted media files on Google Drive to encrypted (drive-to-crypt.sh). The script is set to run at a daily average of 2.75 MB/s, which equates to about 474 GB per day (~237 GB download, encrypt, and ~237 GB reupload). Google Drive Business has a maximum of 750 GB per day.
* Removed watchtower to avoid automatic reboot of containers that use Rclone/MergerFS mount.
