* Several updates 2023_01_26. See full commit log.

* bash_aliases updates due to moving my proxmox server from the cloud back into my home - I now have fiber with 10 Gbps :-)
* Added --drive-stop-on-upload-limit switch to stop rclone upload when google drive errors out due to quota.
* Added crowdsec and traefik-bouncer to basic-services.txt as without them none of the service would be accessible and traefik won't start.
* Remove cf-companion. I now just wildcard all CNAMEs to the root domain pointing to my IP. Much simpler this way and its not a big security risk.
* Updated README with crowdsec related posts.
* Obsoleted cf-companion (see above) and heimdall (replaced with homepage)
* Updated traefik to v2.9
* Updated docker and docker-compose versions.
* Added crowdsecurity/blocklist-mirror to export all the blocked IPs as a list.
* Added whoami container for testing purposes
* Exposed some ports to the host now that my server is inside my home network.
* Added AdGuard Home sync to sync all my instances of adguard home.
