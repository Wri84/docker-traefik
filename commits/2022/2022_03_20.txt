* Several updates 2022_03_20. See full commit log.
* Configured Prowlarr, which is amazing. 
* With prowlarr working, there is no need for Jackett and NZBHydra. Obsoleted both.
* Added flaresolverr to circumvent cloudflare challenge for some of the torrent trackers.
* Minor changes to bash_aliases.
* Added YT-DLP bash_aliases.
* Updated example systemd scripts for Rclone (rclone-drive.service.example and rclone-crypt.service.example) and MergerFS (merge-media.service.example).
* Added a check to see if rclone media upload is already running prior to starting a new one (upload-media.sh.example). 
* Updated media-services.txt to add airsonic-advanced. This should have container names and not service names. 
* Updated README.
* Obsoleted Navidrom and added Airsonic-Advanced with MariaDB backend. Couldn't live without the features of Airsonic.
* Added dupeguru temporarily - I am organizing my music collection and there a ton of duplicate files. 
* Replaced StatPing with Uptime-Kuma, which is awesome. 
* Tried Youtube-DL-Material and MeTube - Couldn't get these to work - Could not resolve host name error. YT-DLP works great.
