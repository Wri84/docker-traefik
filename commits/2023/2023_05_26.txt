* Several updates 2023_05_26. See full commit log.

* A ton of changes. 
* Renamed docker-compose.yml to docker-compose-npm.yml to align with the naming convention used for traefik.
* I was getting tired of my experiments affecting media servers and databases, which were needed 24/7. So split media apps and databases into their own compose. I run this on a separate Ubuntu LXC (unprivileged) container on Proxmox.
* Deleted docker-compose-t2-obsolete.yml. Moved all obsolete apps into their own yml files in the archives folder.
* Major changes on docker-compose-t2.yml (my home server). Extension fields were killing the readability and made it difficult to write guides without explaining. Therefore, I removed extension fields. This will be replicated to Synology and Web Server compose files in future.
* Updated hardware and docker version details in compose files.
* Added docker profiles with the aim of symplifying starting and stopping specific group of services.
* Updated some paths to reflect the new setup.
* Replaced Nzbget with SABnzbd. Nzbget development stopped.
* Archived handbrake, mkvtoolnix, makemkv - rarely used them.
* Temporarily removed glances, qdirstat, AdGuard-Home Sync
* Add IT-Tools, Sitespeed.io (to monitor my site performance)
* Added Lidarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, SABnzbd, and Sonarr exporters to send metrics to Prometheus - I may remove some of this information is also available via Home Assistant InfluxDB. 
* Added Node-Exporter to scrape Docker host metrics into Prometheus for Grafana dashboarding.
* Updated milddlewares.yml removed old settings and cleaned things up a bit.
* Update media-services.txt - This might go away in future after I implement docker profiles.
* Updated README.
* Whats coming: Move traefik CLI commands to traefik.yml to clean up the compose. Add Traefik plugins.
