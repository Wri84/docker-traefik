* Changed docker-compose-t2-media-db.yml to docker-compose-media-db.yml as this stack was not using Traefik.
* Updated docker and docker compose versions in all stacks. 
* Docker extension fields were partially removed in my previous commit. Not its been removed from all my other stacks - due to readability issues.
